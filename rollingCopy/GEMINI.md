# Project: SeedGan Data Augmentation

## Project Overview

This project contains a set of Python scripts designed to augment an image dataset of crops and weeds. The primary goal is to balance the dataset by programmatically adding more crop instances to the images. This is useful for improving the performance of object detection models like YOLO.

The project operates in two main phases:
1.  **Analysis & Planning:** A script analyzes the existing YOLO labels to count the number of crops and weeds, then determines how many crops need to be added to each image to achieve a better balance.
2.  **Image Augmentation:** A subsequent script will use the plan from phase one to paste crop images onto the original images in non-overlapping areas and update the corresponding label files.

## Building and Running

This project consists of Python scripts and does not require a formal build process.

### Dependencies
The scripts are written in Python 3.
- `count_crops.py`: This script uses only standard Python libraries (`os`, `math`).
- `paste_crops.py`: This script requires the **Pillow** library. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install Pillow
  ```

### Scripts

#### `count_crops.py`
-   **Purpose:** Analyzes the label files to create a plan for how many crops to add to each image. It implements a specific counter logic to distribute the crops to be added across the entire dataset.
-   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    python3 count_crops.py
    ```
-   **Input:** It requires the YOLO label files to be located in `rolling images/labels/`.
-   **Output:** For each input label file, it creates a corresponding `.txt` file in the `amount_crops_image/` directory. Each output file contains a single number representing the quantity of crops to add to that image.

#### `paste_crops.py`
-   **Purpose:** This script reads the plan files generated by `count_crops.py` and performs the image augmentation. It pastes crop images onto the original images in non-overlapping areas and updates the corresponding label files.
-   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    python3 paste_crops.py
    ```
-   **Input:**
    - Plan files from `amount_crops_image/`.
    - Original images from `rolling images/images/`.
    - Original labels from `rolling images/labels/`.
    - Crop images from `rolling images/crops/`.
-   **Output:**
    - Augmented images in `rolling images/output/images/`.
    - Augmented labels in `rolling images/output/labels/`.

## Development Conventions

-   **Language:** Python 3.
-   **Data Structure:** The project relies on a specific directory structure for the image data:
    -   `rolling images/images/`: Location of original `.jpg` images.
    -   `rolling images/labels/`: Location of original YOLO `.txt` label files.
    -   `rolling images/crops/`: Location of crop images to be pasted.
    -   `rolling images/output/`: Directory for final augmented images and labels.
        - `images/`: Augmented images.
        - `labels/`: Augmented labels.
    -   `amount_crops_image/`: Directory containing the plan files.
-   **Labels:**
    -   The label files follow the YOLO format (space-separated).
    -   Class `0` is defined as a **crop**.
    -   Class `1` is defined as a **weed**.
